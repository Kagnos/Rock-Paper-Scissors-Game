# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is one of my first javascript projects and it has helped to expand my understanding in many ways. While creating this game I learned how to:
* Implement functions with local variables and nested functions.
* Implement responsive DOM manipulation with event listeners and query selectors.
* Troubleshoot issues with google and forums.
* Implement comprehensive if else statements.
